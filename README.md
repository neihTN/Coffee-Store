# Introduction

This is my **Mobile Development course midterm project**. It simulates a virtual **coffee store** where users can:

- Add and edit personal information  
- Browse and purchase coffee  
- Collect and redeem loyalty points  
- Exchange points for additional coffee or rewards  
- Review order history  

The app is designed to provide a smooth and engaging user experience, showcasing key mobile development concepts such as **state management** and **navigation**.
